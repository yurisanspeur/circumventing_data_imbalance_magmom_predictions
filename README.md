# Circumventing Data Imbalance in Magnetic Ground State Data for Magnetic Moment Predictions
This repository houses all the code and data that should allow for the reproduction of
the results in the paper: "Circumventing Data Imbalance in Magnetic Ground State Data for Magnetic Moment Predictions"

# Usage
In order to be able to run the code, the packages in the `magmom_env.yml` need to be installed.
The code has been tested for this specific set of versions only.

It is also important to mention that one needs to have a PYTHONPATH environment pointing to
the bleeding edge of the open catalyst repo with the slight modifications (Figure S2 of the Supplementary Information (SI)) to the Gemnet OC
model.
